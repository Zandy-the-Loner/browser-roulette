# Browser Roulette?
Yep, Browser Roulette! No back, no website choosing! Start at Google, you pick the end!

# Disclaimer:
Forked due to laziness. This is the only active fork, counting the original.

# How does it work?
It's basically a generic Web Page entity that's open on google, and text. Call it "Minimalmistic" if you want.

# Does this include work from others?
INSPARATION: Wikibattle (https://wikibattle.me/)

# Should I use this browser on a daily basis?
This should only be used as a joke, and should be handled as nothing but a joke.

# Why is there nothing here?
I have yet to hook up my computer. After that, it's reinstalling Windows, Visual Basic, and then work will be started.


# Who are the beta testers?

Amara (pre-project).

UNSURE: Toast, Angelic
